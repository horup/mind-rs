An experimental crude mind training game written in Rust, which might or might not improve flow state of the mind.

The goal of the game is to repeat what is shown on the screen as fast as possible.
Every now an then, the game will ask you to think about some topic and then continue.

questions.txt must be in the same folder as the executable.
questions.txt can be extended with additional questions that make sense for you.

The game was inspired by the book: Stealing Fire, which talks about altered states of the mind...

It is currently unknown if the game does indeed help with flow state, or if it is 'a waste of time'.
